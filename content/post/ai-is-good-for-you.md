I've never really followed a training plan that wasn't my own, but I admit that training for an ultra is outside of my wheelhouse so I was going to need some help. I opted to use the half-marathon training program inside of the Garmin Connect app since I was running a half-marathon in June. The plan seemed reasonable. I liked the easy instruction that was provided and how it integrated into my Garmin watch. It had guided workouts and drills that were clearly laid out. I think Garmin did a great job with this training feature as a whole.

However, I ultimately found the program lacked diversity in the types of runs it offered. It was inflexible in adjusting runs and had little regard for my physical limitations. I was close to injury after 6 weeks from overtraining. I'm not entirely blaming the app for this. I  could have run slower than the recommended pace or not run on days where my body didn't feel prepared. I kinda knew I was improperly training but kept pressing on because I was able to do the work.

I took a few weeks off to let my legs recover and decide on what I was going to do next. I still liked the idea of an AI-based program that adapts to the runner and that's how I stumbled across **T**rain**A**s**O**NE. They offer plans similar to Garmin except they have marthon+ distances and the service is even more tailored to the individual runner. **TAO** will automatically recalculate your workouts if you miss a run, or you deviate from a planned run. I commented earlier on how inflexible the Garmin plans were and TAO is the complete opposite. There were many days I'd wake up to a different scheduled run. TAO ended up making me a more flexible runner to accommodate their automatic changes. That's not a negative against the service, it's just something I wasn't used to.

I'm a few weeks into TAO and my only real complaint is the TAO Garmin watch app doesn't work well for me. The pace on the app doesn't match the pace on the standard Garmin workout screen. I've seen deviations of up to 1 min/mile. I've corresponded with someone at TAO and they told me that their app uses the measurements directly from the watch. My solution was to not use their app workout screen while running and stick with the standard Garmin workout screen. It's a mild inconvenience but something I'm fine with overlooking given how well the service has been working. I'm not going to pitch their service so here's a blurb from their [website](https://www.trainasone.com "TrainAsONE").

I'll post a follow-up to the program once I complete the [Baker Lake 50K]({{< ref "first-official-ultra.md" >}}). I'm on the fence if I'll be able to complete the race given some other setbacks but I'm optimistic about my training and the service.
