Finding the right piece of gear can be tricky. There are lots of things that go into making something work in a way you'd expect, and what you want may not be what the manufacturer or another runner might want. This pretty much sums up my experience trying to find a hydration vest.

I've run with hydration packs, belts, and handheld bottles in the past. They were each a good tool but I wasn't pleased with them over multi-hour runs. I wanted something that got out of my way and let me focus on my ~~suffering~~ running. I looked at a few of the big names like Salomon, Nathan, Ultimate Direction, and Camelbak and quickly realized I was lost with so many choices. I couldn't try on any of these vests either due to COVID, and I wasn't about to start ordering various models after [the fiasco with the HOKAs](https://williamthresher.com/post/2020/running-on-clouds/ "Running on Clouds").

> I wanted something that got out of my way and let me focus on my ~~suffering~~ running.

I settled on getting an Ultimate Direction (UD) pack. I just wasn't sure of which model to choose because I didn't know what I needed. How many liters of water do I carry? Do I need lashing on the outside? What about inside storage? How many hours was I going to use the pack for? UD had a model for every scenario and it was overwhelming so I did what any rational person does. I said screw it and bought the [Osprey Duro 1.5](https://www.osprey.com/us/en/product/duro-1-5-with-1-5l-reservoir-DURO1POINT5S19.html "Duro 1.5"). Didn't see that coming did you? I think it was an ad on Instagram where I first saw the vast and remember thinking that it was nice looking. The reviews said it was a pretty solid product too.

I learned a lot about the pack over the first few runs such as the chest straps aren't great. Solomon got it right with their diagonal sternum strap design. I replicated that and it fixed the fit issue I was having around my chest. The side pockets on the vest weren't as useful as I was hoping. They're small and useless for anything larger than gloves/hat/headlamp. I was hoping to be able to stuff a light jacket in one of them but that was a no-go. This leads to the last issue, there simply isn't any space to carry stuff. Osprey makes the [Duro 6](https://www.osprey.com/us/en/product/duro-6-with-1-5l-reservoir-DURO6S19.html "Duro 6") which has a large pocket but it's more pack than I need. I just wanted to be able to carry a light jacket should it rain on me.

One of the things I noticed on other packs that were missing from the Duro 1.5 is outside webbing. This allows for items to be strapped down to the outside of the pack for easy access. I thought that should be easy enough to design so I bought some hooks, elastic cord, and got to work. I chose to break some of the seams and sew loops underneath the fabric to make the pack look cleaner, but also to strengthen the stitches on the loops. I put one loop on the bottom of the vest and one on each side in the middle and looped the cord through the hooks making the cord cross in the middle and attach to the top of the pack with hooks. I also added an adjustment point so I could tighten the straps down. It took a few hours in total but I'm really happy with the results.

I could have saved myself a lot of time and bought a pack that had more storage or webbing but my money was spent. A little DIY is good for you and I now have a pack that is custom to my needs. Not bad for a day's work.
