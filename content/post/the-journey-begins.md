excerpt: This is my obligatory Hello World post as a geek but also why I'm here.

I've been a runner most of my life. It started when I was a child running with my father. I ran summer track in my pre-teen years and later joined the high school track and cross-country teams. Sure I've taken breaks over the years due to injury or life, but running is that constant I keep coming back to.

One of my favorite things about running is the time I get to spend in my head. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the company of others and the social aspect that comes with group runs, the satisfaction that comes from completing a long or difficult run, and the runner's high. However, It's the time spent alone that is most therapeutic.

It's been like this most of my running life. My high school cross-country/track coach would constantly yell at me for not applying myself.  He was always encouraging me to "get out there" or "run harder." It's not that I wasn't capable of performing at a competitive level. I just didn't need to. I ran for myself, for the joy of running.

This year (2020) marks a new beginning for me. I'm running my first official 50K ultramarathon in the Fall. I look forward to the challenge ahead, to how far I can push myself both physically and mentally. Above all, I look forward to getting lost in my head in order to find myself.

This is going to be an interesting journey for me. I plan on sharing all sorts of stuff that comes up along the way. I hope that you'll share in this journey with me.
